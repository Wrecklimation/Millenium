Basic Walkthrough for Graham Nelson's Jigsaw 
3nd and *Final* Revision
by bonni mierzejewska

This is as complete as one person (that person being me) can make it.  Many
thanks to those who contributed feedback to improve this walkthrough.  'Tis
the last revision.  Any typos are here to stay.

CENTURY PARK

You begin in Century Park on New Year's Eve, 1999.  There's a party raging
that is giving you a headache, and you're trying to avoid it as long as 
possible.

Go east.  This is the Beer Tent, and you'll catch sight of that intriguing
stranger in black (everyone was supposed to wear white to this party, as you
know if you read the party ticket in your possession).  Get the sparkler from  
the potato.  Going back west, you find that Black has left you a jigsaw 
puzzle piece.  Take it.

Go southeast to behind the Beer Tent.  Take the rucksack and search the crate 
(examine it, too - it's stamped A4).  Take the curious device and the tagged 
key.

Going back NW, go NE to the churchyard.  Go E into the church, and E again
into the vestry.  Look under the stool and get the pencil; look in the stool
and get Emily's book.  Go W twice (back to the churchyard) and sketch the
night-jar.  Then go SW to Century Park and W to Kaldecki's Monument.  Climb
the monument and examine the lightning-conductor.  It's made of fuse.  Light
it and there will be a boom.  Go D and enter the Monument.  You won't be
able to exit again, but don't worry.  You don't need to.

In the Monument you'll see a display case.  You can examine it and its
contents, but you won't be able to do anything with it for a while, so you
can ignore it for now.  Go E further into the pyramid.  You'll find a dusty
room with a table and a clock.  (You can take a look at the room SE, too,  
while you're here.)  Look under the table; you'll find another puzzle piece.    
Now clean the table and you'll find a puzzle board.  (Examine it and you get  
a nice graphic display.)  It has sixteen spaces, four rows and four columns: 
the rows are labeled A to D and the columns are labeled 1 to 4.  Take a look 
at the corner piece you found in Century Park and turn it until it fits at 
A4, the upper right hand corner.  It will light up with a picture of parklands 
strobed by laser light.  Take the centre piece and put it at C2.  If it 
doesn't light up, pick it up again (type "get C2"), turn it, and place it at 
C2, repeating until the piece lights up.

Now, get the ormolu clock and set it to 59 ("set clock to 59").  Press C2
(pressing A4 does nothing, because you've solved that now).  You will be
transported.....

FLAT OVER THE STREET

Don't try the door.  It's locked, and you haven't got the key.  However, the
tagged key you found in the crate fits the dresser.  Unlock the dresser and
open it and you will find another jigsaw piece.  About this time, Black will
come through the door.

Shake hands with Black.  (I don't know why, but this gets you a point.)  Just
let Black talk; you'll find out a lot.  When Black asks you if you understand,
say no to get more info.  Then just wait around until Black gives you the
sniper's rifle.  Slip off the safety ("switch rifle off") and wait some more,
until the Archduke shows up.  Unpleasantly, what you must do then is shoot the
duke ("shoot duke").  (So much for "Violence is seldom the answer, you know"!)
Sketch the horses.  Then wait around a bit.  The time window will open; Black
will take the curious device.  Watch what Black does, so you can do it later.
The device causes the disturbed air to condense into a black sphere, into
which Black disappears.  At this point, you can wait until the clock runs out
or simply set the clock to 1 and zip out of there.  (If you don't get  
transported right away, type "look" and you will be.)  You will be transported 
to the Disc Room in the Monument.  Go NW, and you're back at the puzzle board.

BACK AT THE MONUMENT

There's a reason why I don't use pronouns to refer to Black.  Graham Nelson
never does.  Black's gender is deliberately left indeterminate.  Black on some
occasions displays definitely female behaviour and on other occasions displays
definitely male behaviour.  This allows you to assign to Black whatever gender
interests you.  There's a reason for that, too, which will become clear to you
as you continue on in the game.

You might also be wondering why you need to be drawing all these animals.  Well,
since this is a walkthrough and a cheat, I'll tell you that you can't win the
game unless you draw at least 4 animals in the course of the game.  Some of them,
however, are a challenge to capture on paper and are a challenge in and of
themselves.  I found it interesting to find and draw all of them.  There are
(not much of a surprise here) exactly 16 animals to draw (just as there are 16
puzzle pieces and 16 sections of the Land).

The device Black took from you will be on the puzzle board.  In addition to
opening the time window, it tells you what year you're in (examine it when
you're in a chapter).  Put in your sack.

Examine the piece you got.  Turn it until the flat edge is at the left and
put it at C1.  It will light up with a picture of a cocktail glass with ice.
From now on, what you need to do to fire up the puzzle is set the clock to
59 (or whatever), and press the chosen location.  Press C1 to be transported.....

S.S. TITANIC

...to the Reading Room aboard the Titanic on the last night of its fateful
voyage.  There's a note for you from Black and a newspaper.  Read them if
you like.  Then go SW to the First Class Lounge, N to the Port Promenade
(fore), W to Port Promenade (aft), S to Adjoining Staircase, and U to the
Boat Deck.  Ignore the first aid box; you don't need it.  On the Boat Deck,
move the chairs so you can get to Black's chair.  You'll find a book.  Get
the book and open it, and an elegant key falls out.  Get it.  Then read the
book and remember the new distress code: CQD.  Now go D and N,E,S back to
the First Class Lounge.

Go E to the First Class Entrance.  While you're here, go U to the Top of
Stairs, take note that this is where the wireless room is, and go W to the
Gymnasium.  Take the jacket you find and go E and D again.  From the First
Class Entrance, go E to the Cabins.  Unlock Black's door with the elegant
key, open it, and go E to enter it.  There, look under the wardrobe to get
the Kaldecki Device (kd for short) and another note from Black.  Get the
long barrelled key from the table and open the porthole.  A jigsaw piece will
fall to the floor, which you can now get.  Read the note for a little extra
info about the kd.

The Kaldecki Device is useful the first time you play the game.  Turn it
("turn kd") when you're in a chapter, and it will tell you the number of
jigsaw pieces you have (or have left) to find there.

At some point during your explorations of Black's cabin, the Stewardess will
enter and grab a previously-unseen-to-you towel.  This is useful if you want
to stick around to the very end for a chance to open a time window.  If not,
you'll have other opportunities to enter a time window.  At some point before
the endgame, you need to do so; the first time you do, you get a point.

Now, go back W twice to the Lounge, N and W and S to the Stairs, wear the
jacket and go W into the Smoking Room.  Wait around until Benjamin Guggenheim
gives you a letter.  Once you have it, go W again into Palm Court and give
the letter to Miss Shutes.  She'll squeak and leave, disbanding her ouija
game.  Now you can look, and you'll see the jigsaw piece left here.  Take it. 

Now you need to go back to the wireless room.  Once there, unlock the door
with the long key, open it, and go E to enter.  There's a morse key here and
charts with morse code on it.  Remember the CQD?  You need to key it in now.
It's on the charts.  "Dah" is a dash, and "dit" is a dot; C is -.-. :  Q is
--.- : D is -..  and you need to key them in succession with no pauses.  This
solves the temporal crisis here.  The letter you gave Miss Shutes *has* to
make it to its addressee; you just made sure that Miss Shutes would be rescued
by the S.S. Carpathia.

Now you can either escape back to the Monument by using the clock, or wait
around for the time window.  Examine the towel; on it is the location where
the time window opens.  It will open at the precise minute that the Titanic
sinks.  Be there before 2:10!  AS SOON AS you see the air disturbance, press
the button on the curious device.  The Titanic will make it's plunge for the
bottom, but you'll survive long enough to dive into the black ball.

If you decide to stay until the bitter end, turn off the alarm on the clock, so
you don't get whisked back to the monument prematurely.  Just don't forget to
turn it back on again if you want to leave a chapter using the clock!

A note about the compass directions.  If you lay them out, you'll notice that
Graham Nelson has the Titanic heading due east.  I find this improbable, since
the Titanic sank just south of Newfoundland heading for New York City, but
maybe he knows more than I do.  :->

IN THE BLACK BALL

Just wait around a turn or two.  You can't do anything.

IN THE LAND

Search around until you find the pyramid.  Very little of the Land is open at 
this point in the game, and there's no point in trying to explore the mist.  I
think if you enter the Land from the Titanic chapter you arrive outside the
Chinese Pagoda.  Go in and take a look if you like.  The pyramid is E of the
Pagoda.  This will take you to the SW corner of the pyramid; to enter the
door, go NE.

Whether you use the Land or the clock to get back to the Monument, you are
always transported to the Disc Room.

BACK AT THE MONUMENT

Back at the Monument, you've got these two pieces, and edge piece and a corner
piece.  The corner piece is A1, so turn it until it will fit there.  It will
light up with a picture of mould in a petri dish.  Turn the edge piece to fit
at B1.  It will light up with a picture of an invalid in bed.

It doesn't matter which piece you press next.  Here we'll go to A1.

CLARENCE WING

Okay, first open the lower door and go D into the Asthma Lab.  Draw the
white mice, then go N to the lab assistant's office.  Penicillium?  Mould?
Ah!  We're here to help Fleming discover penicillin!  Get the jar.  You can't,
but you will find a note from Black.  Go S and U, open the upper door, and
go into Fleming's laboratory.  Look under the bench and get the petri dish
you find there.  Get the certificate, which dislodges a jigsaw piece.  Get it.

Occasionally Fleming will interrupt your nosing about; the first time he does,
he'll leave his heavy suitcase.  Put the dish on the suitcase and push the
suitcase E (it's too heavy for you to carry).  Wait around until Fleming comes
along, finds the petri dish, and dashes off.  You've just solved the temporal
crisis.  Wait a bit to take the time window if you didn't opt to take the one
on the Titanic.

BACK AT THE MONUMENT

The piece you found at A1 needs to go at C3 (a racing steam locomotive).  Do 
the take/turn/put routine on it if it doesn't light up the first time you 
place it there.  Now, on to B1.

TEMPS PERDU

You're in Paris.  Ignore the door at 44 Rue Hamelin for now and go north.
You can read the paper if you like.  Go N again, into the streets of Paris.
Locals will go by, and the game tells you what direction they go.  Go that
way!  After several turns of this, you will find a flask of absinthe.  Drink
it.  You'll have an hallucination of being at a dance party, and Black will 
be there.  Dance with Black.  This ends the hallucination, and somehow you're
back at Avenue Kleber.  Now go south twice.  See the coin?  You can get it 
now.  Take it and go N, open that intriguing door and go E into it.  Give the 
coin to the bellboy and get into the lift.  Go to the top floor, get the 
piece, and down to the Fifth Floor.  Exit the lift and go E into the 
apartment.  Get the tea tray, which turns out to be a puzzle piece.  You have 
to get it again, because somehow in getting it, you dropped it.  Also get the 
madeleine (which can also be referred to as "cake").  Get back to the lift and 
down to the street.  

Go S and W to the Maison du The.  You'll see a forgotten bowl of jasmine tea.  
Dip the madeleine in it and eat it.  You'll have yet another dreamy sequence.  
This time you need to swing the pendulum, and you're back at the Maison du 
The.  See that paperole that was on the clock?  It's on the floor now.  Take 
it and go back to the fifth floor apartment.  Drop the paperole, and you've 
solved the temporal crisis (restoring the crucial final passage to Proust's 
last work).  There are no animals here to sketch.

Hang around a turn or two if you want to take advantage of the time window.
You'll start to notice that every time you return to the Land, there's more
of it.  The Land is a 4x4 grid of sections...and so is the puzzle.  Every time
you place a jigzaw piece in the correct place, the corresponding section of the
Land coalesces from the mists.

BACK AT THE MONUMENT

Okay, now you've got two more pieces.  The edge piece goes to B4 (the Snow
lands), and the centre piece goes to B2 (Kitty Hawk and the Wright Flyer).
But for now, let's go to the train at C3.

LENIN'S TRAIN

You're on the train Lenin took when he returned to Russia.  Go E, wear the
uniform, open the trunk and search it, then go back to the corridor and unlock
the west compartment door with the little key you found.  Open it, enter, 
there's a man tied up here!  But don't free him, or you end up getting shot
during the October Revolution.  Search him instead, which makes him furious,
but you need that permit.  Out to the corridor again, go S into the soldier's
compartment.  Be polite!  Ask them for a piece of pashka.  They'll obligingly
tell you to have it.  Take it and go N twice to Lenin's compartment.  Lenin
himself is here, but he's not paying attention to anyone.  Go NE.  There's an
engaging little boy here, and a piece of paper which you need.  Give the
pashka to the boy, and he'll let you have the paper.  Take it and give it to
Lenin, who will sign it.

Now take your chit and go NW.  You'll be in line for the smoking room.  Wait
until you get in.  You've got barely enough turns to accomplish what you need
to do here.  Look under the bunk, open the vent, get the tray (which turns out
to be a puzzle piece), and put it in the vent.  No, it's not gone forever.
Go S before the other passengers kick you out.

Now go NE again and N to the back end of the train.  There's a bomb here!  Get
it and throw it.  You've just saved Lenin's life so he can start the Bolshevik
Revolution, more's the pity.  Get the piece, too.  Now you can either go back
S once to advantage of the time window, or use the clock to get back to the 
Monument.  There are no animals here to sketch.

At this point, I have a theory as to your gender.  Since you're able to 
plausibly wear the British Army uniform, my guess is that your gender is
supposed to be male, making Black female (you'll find out later in the game
that you are definitely opposite genders).  Don't let your 1990's liberated
sensibilities trip you up here - in 1917, it was improbably to find any female
British Army officers!

BACK AT THE MONUMENT

The piece from Lenin's train goes at A2.  Let's go there.

ABBEY ROAD

Not much to do here.  You peer in the window and take a look at four scruffy
young men...yes, the Beatles.  Black is here.  Wait around.  Black will start
humming loudly, presumably to throw the Beatles off.  The only way to restore
the quiet they need is to kiss Black.  Graham Nelson has a little romance in
him!  Hang around for the time window or use the clock.  There are no puzzle
pieces here, and no animals to sketch.

BACK AT THE MONUMENT

Where to next?  Let's do the pieces you acquired in Paris next.  Press B2 this
time.

KITTY HAWK - THE FLYER

There's a paper dart here.  Pick it up and throw it a few times.  Notice what
happens?  Now go D to the railing.  The Wright brothers are using this railing
to get their Flyer off the ground.  Examine the crowd and draw the Yorkshire
terrier.  Go E and get the bread and the anemometer.  Go E again into the
machine shop.  There's a mandolin here.  Take it and play it.  Play it again.
You're getting better!  Play it until you can play Vivaldi.  Now go E into
the kitchen.  There's a mousetrap here!  Put some bread into the trap, wait
until the mouse comes by.  You might have to wait a while before the mouse
actually pauses to inspect the trap.  Immediately sketch the mouse.  Now
go W and up into the loft bedroom.  Get the cap.  You don't need it, but now
you can see the box of mosquito powder, which you do need.  Take it and go
back down.  Go W to the hangar and N.  You'll be at the bottom of the hill.

The reason why the Flyer keeps landing so quickly is because the windspeed 
goes up and down in cycles (you can verify this with the anemometer), and
they're missing the peak.  Wait there until Orville lands and play the
mandolin for him two times in a row.  He'll like it and stick around.  Then 
wait, and the Flyer should fly this time.  *Now* you can get near the Flyer,
because everyone has raced off to town to telegraph the world.  Examine it;
there's a loose square on the aileron.  Get it - it's a puzzle piece!  
Unfortunately, you get caught in the wires and they have to extricate you, but
they don't care at this point.  You end up on the beach.  There's a bottle
bobbing in the waves.  Wait until it's almost to hand, and get it.  There's
a message from Black in it.

Now go back to the machine shop.  Shake the mosquito powder and examine the
heater.  See the little holes?  Put bread in them.  If you hadn't shaken the
mosquito powder, the mouse would come along and steal the bread.  The powder
repels it.  The heater will explode, and you can get the lid, which turns out
to be another puzzle piece.

The time window does show up here, but not in the machine shop.  I *think* it
opens at the beach (look around for it if you like - but be warned that it
only exists for about 2-3 turns).  If you don't want to fool with that, take
the clock back to the Monument.  You should have drawn two animals here.

BACK AT THE MONUMENT

Okay, the centre piece from the Flyer is B3 (Ghost Plane), and the creased
edge piece from the heater is D3 (Cabbages).  But we're still working on the
pieces we got from Paris, so let's press B4 this time.

IN THE WILDERNESS

Something's gone a little wrong.  You're in a white place.  Black is there,
confused, and asks you if you can see ahead.  It doesn't matter what you do or
say.  The whiteness resolves on the next turn into a cold whiteness, and 
you're in the Snowlands.

SNOWLANDS

Sketch the snow goose, and go E until you run into the snow leopard.  Don't 
worry; it won't hurt you.  Just draw it and head back W until you're either 
back at Tundra with the snow goose or the Copse of Fir Trees.  If you end up 
at the Copse, go SW into the shed, get the grain and the broom and NE again, 
and E to the Tundra.  If you end up in the Tundra, go E to the Copse (might 
as well examine the nest while you're there) and get the broom and the handful 
of grain from the shed.  If you end up in the Snowy Basin, go U to the Tundra, 
E to the Copse, etc.

Now go U.  Get the coil of cable on this crag and go D twice to the Snowy 
Basin.  Sweep the snow.  Yes, sweep the snow.  You uncover a disc around a 
ten foot shaft.  Examine the disc and you find a ring attached to it.  Tie 
the cable to the ring and go D.  

Wonder of wonders, there's a US missile here.  You weren't in Siberia after
all!  Examine it; you'll find a hatch.  Open the hatch and go inside.  You
don't have much time now - the missile just started vibrating.  Press the
green button (releases a puzzle piece from the hatch) and the blue button 
(solves the temporal crisis).  Out, get the piece, and up.  Quickly.  If you 
hang around you will die.  Also quickly untie the coil of cable from the ring 
before the missile fires and the silo shuts on it; you'll need it once more.  

Go up and give the handful to the goose by *dropping it on the ground* (this
will keep her busy while you plunder her nest), then W to the Copse.  Throw 
the cable at the nest and pull the cable *twice*.  You'll get the puzzle 
piece; be sure to pick it up!

Doing things in this order is more efficient (having been informed by email
and after trying this order myself).  However, you probably won't be able to
take advantage of the time window this way, since it opens shortly after the
missile fires.  (The time window opens shortly after the temporal crisis is
solved, regardless of whether or not you have all the puzzle pieces to be
found.)

You should have found two pieces and drawn two animals in this chapter.

BACK AT THE MONUMENT

Okay!  The corner piece from the nest goes at D4 (Barge), and the edge piece
from the missile goes at C4 (Moon).  Let's do the pieces from Kitty Hawk.
These are the hardest puzzles in the game, in my opinion.  Let's do B3 now.

GHOST PLANE

Time is precious here.  Go N to the cockpit.  There's a control panel with
buttons and dials, and the engine fire light is on.  Press CUTENG/L (cut left
engine), and the fire will go out.  But now you're running out of fuel.  Sit 
in the navigator's chair and turn on the radio.  Immediately get up and press 
AUT/P (autopilot).  Now scamper S twice to the Fusilage Ring, and go W to
the west bomb bay.  Examine the hole, then examine the control there.  It says
RES/F (reserve fuel).  Press it.  **PHEW**  Now you've got lots of time.  Go
back to the Fusilage Ring, put everything in your sack and drop it.  Examine
the locker and get the safe (you can't carry the safe and *anything* else).
Take the safe E to the east bomb bay and drop it.  Now you've got some waiting
to do.  This is a long chapter, so turn the alarm off on your clock.

Get your sack and go back to the cockpit.  If you like you can go D and 
examine and clean and read the pinup there, but you don't want to do what it
says.  What you need to do now is lower the plane.  Push the control column
forward until you're at about 760 feet.  Wait.  Wait some more.  When you
get to about 20% fuel, start paying attention.  A few turns later (pay 
attention!) forest will be rushing under you.  Press LOWER/U *now*.  This 
lowers the landing gear.  As soon as you do that, you'll see a landing strip.  
Type "land" to land the plane.

You're very short on time now.  Immediately press REL/B.  You'll here a clank.  
Exit.  The game will tell you that you won't be able to get back in the plane.  
You want to exit anyway, so type exit again (or "g" to repeat your previous 
exit command).  Immediately go E.  Examine the parachute you find here - there 
will be a little gadget in it.  Immediately go W and put the gadget on the 
safe.  This will unlock it.  Open it and get the folder and the shelf (which
turns out to be a puzzle piece.)  You don't need the folder, but it makes for
interesting reading later, so go ahead and get that.  Put all in your sack to
expedite things later, and let yourself get captured.

An alternative way to do this, I have been informed, is to put the safe in 
your sack.  You're able to carry it this way.  (Graham Nelson could fix this
minor bug in any subsequent release, so be sure to save before you try it.)
If this works, all you need to do is search the parachute to get the gadget,
put it in your sack, and unlock the safe when you're back in the Monument.

If you are playing Release 1, there's another bug to be aware of - if you are
still wearing the British Army uniform when you get captured, the Russians
remove it, but it's still flagged as being worn.  To avoid this, remove it
while you're still on the plane and drop it.  This is important in the Enigma
machine chapter.

Captured!  Black is here.  Black's been under interrogation and is drugged.
Ask Black anything and you'll get the same reply.  Read the folder if you like.
Within a few turns, a wind will blow the door open.  No time to lose!  Go N,
get your sack, back S, and the air currents will be disturbed!  Press the
button on the curious device and put Black's drugged body into the ball.  The 
temporal crisis was Black's presence.   This seems to be the only chapter in
which you *must* use the time window to leave.  If you don't, you wreck the
course of history.  Perhaps this was the author's way of making sure you get
the point for entering the Land?

No animals to be drawn here.

BACK AT THE MONUMENT

The edge piece from the plane is D2 (a lady in a crinoline dress).  Now that  
you have the gadget, you can open the case in the Monument.  Go W, put the
gadget on the case, open it, and get the model, which turns out to be a
puzzle piece.  Get the gadget, which has fallen on the floor.  It's not
necessary anymore, but it's useful later.  The puzzle piece goes at D1
(parklands with iron gates).

Let's press D3 now, decidedly the most difficult and tedious puzzle in the 
game.

FIELDS OF CABBAGES/ENIGMA MACHINE

You're a ghost.  You can't go anywhere but in the barn (just type "in").  In 
the barn you find Black, busily working away at a strange typewriter.  And 
Black doesn't seem to be able to see you.  No one can!  Examine the 
typewriter.  Notice that three wires are not plugged into the machine.  
Examine the paper on the floor and WRITE DOWN WHAT YOU SEE.  The two numbers 
at the top change with every game.  The letters stay constant.  They are:
a - g
w - c
v - t
u - j
y - r

You can fly!  Take note of the wheels on top of the wardrobe.  They're NOT
in the machine.

Okay, got that?  Go back out, and fly.  You'll bump your head on something
and be back at the Monument.  You'll notice that the picture on D3 has
changed to a Victorian country house.  Turn off the clock alarm just in case, 
and press D3 again.

Now you're in a duck blind.  Get the spent cartridge.  If you're still wearing
any uniform, remove it now!  Then go E into the other part of the blind.
Look in the window and you'll see a mallard to sketch.  Get the cap and wear
it.  Now go W and N.  Yes, you want to get caught.  When the corporal asks
you what you are, say either "poacher" or "codebreaker."  You'll be taken off
to Hut 31.

Now things are really cooking.  You'll see a crate.  Open it.  The game will
tell you this will break the seal irrevocably.  Open it anyway.  Remove the
machine from the crate.  Now, there's an intercept on the wall.  You really
don't have to take it, but you should the first time you play the game just
to see what's going on.  Examine the machine, examine the wires.  Look in the
crate.  There are five wheels, and the machine can only hold three.  Remember
the two on top of the wardrobe?  Those are the ones you *don't* use.

Get wheel II and put it in the machine.  Turn it until it shows the first 
number that was on the Wehrmacht paper in the barn.  Get wheel IV and set it
to the second number that was on the paper.  You don't know what the third
number is, so just get wheel V and put it in the machine.

Now, the wires.  When you examined them, you should have gotten basic 
instructions.  So type "unstecker" to remove all of them.  Now, you need the
letter combinations that were on the paper.  Type "stecker a to g" and so on
down the list.  But you know, there were three wires unplugged from the
machine in the barn, and you only have five wires plugged in.  You need to
find the last two combinations.  This is tedious, so here they are: d-f, and
p-x.  Okay, now pull the lever.  This puts the machine into decryption mode,
and you're all set.

Type "type intercept" to keep from having to type in every single letter
every time.  If you don't get the message, you have to press the red button,
turn wheel V, and type the intercept again.  Do this until you get the 
message.  When you finally do (and it can take up to 10 tries, since each
wheel has ten positions and you don't know what setting to use for wheel V), 
you get imprisoned.  Not to worry, you still have you're possessions, and a 
time window opens up within a few turns.

BACK AT THE MONUMENT

**PHEW**  The two hardest puzzles are over.  Now let's go to the moon to
collect the last puzzle piece.  Set your clock and press C4.

MOON

You're in a tiny cabin in a lunar module in orbit around the moon.  Black is
here (surprise, surprise).  Get the atlas you see here.  Examine the
surroundings and wait until Black mutters something about Littrow, and
look that up in the atlas ("look up littrow in atlas").  The coordinates for
Littrow aren't what Black muttered!  Quick, show the atlas to Black, who now
can correct the Othello's course and land in the right place.  BTW, it's a
bit of useful info to ask Black about the astronauts.  The Apollo 17
astronauts didn't die!  Black wants to save them too, so this time you're
working *with* Black instead of *against* Black.  Nothing to do now until the
Othello lands.  This is a longish chapter, so turn off the alarm on the clock.

Now, go D to go outside.  Get in the lunar rover, turn the joystick on, and 
go S.  Get the gnomon.  Now go N three times to Emory Crater and get the Green
Clod.  Go N once to the Apollo 17, N once more to the North Massif and get the 
sunshade.  Go E to Station 6 Rock, get out of the rover and climb the boulder.  
A pod!  Open it with the gnomon to find Waldo and his rather terse instruction 
sheet.  Now get Waldo and the paper and head back for the rover.  Head S to 
Apollo 17 and W to find out why you're here.  There's a Pu238 rod here that's 
got a crack in it.  Wrap it with the sunshade.  You can pick up the rod if you 
have both hands free, but you can't open the reactor.  Hmm.  There's a plug on 
the end of the cable leading out of the door of the reactor, and there's a 
socket on Waldo.  But first, you need to do a little bit more exploring.

Go W twice.  SW, you can see the genuine astronauts' rover.  Best not let
your own rover be seen.  So get out, and go SW.  Examine their rover.  Gee, 
I wonder what that makeshift fender is made of?  But how do you get it?  Ah!
Waldo!  Head back for the Othello, where Black will make a fuss about Waldo.

There, you need to program Waldo.  You can't do that outside, because the
gloves make your fingers too thick.  The commands are on the paper, but you
also need to add a bit of info: how many *times* Waldo is to execute the 
command.  And you can only give Waldo eight commands, too.  So after much
figuring, you find out that RTURN and LTURN make Waldo turn only 45 degrees
each time.  Also, the crater the astronauts currently occupy is roughly 
square, and they're in the SW corner while you come in at the NE corner. Some
onsite experimentation, and you find that each FORWARD command advances Waldo
only halfway along the crater's rim.  So you come up with this program:

type FORWARD 2 (takes Waldo along the eastern rim to SE corner)
type RTURN 2 (turns Waldo west)
type FORWARD 2 (takes Waldo along the southern rim to SW corner)
type RTURN 2 (turns Waldo north)
type SAMPLE 1 (Waldo grabs the fender/puzzle piece)
type FORWARD 2 (takes Waldo along the western rim to NW corner)
type RTURN 2 (turns Waldo east)
type FORWARD 2 (takes Waldo along northern rim and back to you)


Head back to Tortilla Flat (SW of Shorty Crater).  Once there, you need to 
distract the astronauts so they don't see Waldo.  Throw the green clod.  
They'll be fascinated with it.  Drop Waldo, turn it till it's facing south 
("turn waldo") and push the pink button.  If all goes well, you'll have Waldo 
and the puzzle piece.

The temporal crisis here is the fuel rod.  It's going to kill the astronauts,
and you can't allow that.  You discover that you can plug the cable into Waldo
and that if Waldo is programmed to go forward with the cable plugged in, the
reactor door will open.  You also discover that you can't remove the cable
from Waldo while it's taut.  

You can manage to solve this with the program currently in Waldo.  Put Waldo 
down, plug in the cable, make sure there's nothing in your hands, push the 
button, get the fuel rod, put it in the reactor when the door opens.  Waldo
will trundle around on the end of the cable for a bunch of turns, then 
eventually come back so that the reactor door closes.  Pick Waldo up at this 
point, causing it to abort its program.

Getting the rod into the reactor solves the crisis.  Back at the Othello, 
leave Waldo in the rover (so you don't end up having the game ask you which 
button you want to press, the pink hexagonal one or the white button on the 
curious device) and go up into the module.  Black will want to take a walk.  
Use the time window or the clock to get back to the Monument.

Obviously, there are no animals to draw here.

BACK AT THE MONUMENT

The piece from the moon goes at A3.  The board should be complete now!  Let's
see, what's next....Let's go to Berlin.  Fire up the clock and press A3.

BERLIN

You're in East Berlin.  Depressing place.  It's 1989, the year the Wall came
down.  You wonder why you're here...

To the east is a hoarding; it just tells you what year it is.  Go W to Near
the Brandenburg Gate, then N to the alley and N again to the river.  Get the
rope you find there.  Then back S to the alley.  There are hares in no man's
land.  You try to draw them, but you get stopped.  How to draw them?  This
is risky.  Climb the fence, go SW, draw the hare, go SE, climb the fence, and
you're (sort of) safe.  **PHEW**  Now head S, and S again to the apartment.
Enter the apartment, go up, and get the purse you find there.  Open it and
take the fifty Ost-mark note and the key.  Then back down to the street.  Head
east to Checkpoint Charlie and examine the blockhouse to the south.  Black!
You can hang around and watch what happens when Black makes the crossing.  Is
this victory?  You don't feel like it is....

You head north from here and find a Skoda.  The cyrillic-lettered key goes to
it.  Unlock the Skoda, open it, get in, turn it on, and go north.  A man will
ask to clean your windows; give him the fifty.  He'll toss in a note.  Uh-oh,
you have to thwart Black this time.  Black thinks the Wall mustn't come down
until 1991, and you know that's not right.  You're at Unter Den Linden, where
the hoarding is; go W twice and S back to the decrepit apartment building.

Leave the engine running and get out of the Skoda.  What I didn't tell you is
that in your explorations of the apartment, you searched that masonry that's
all over the floor and discovered a trap door leading down.  Go down now, and
DON'T GO WEST.  Go into that little crevice SW.  Tie the rope to the telephone
cables.  Then go up (through the manhole) and you'll see the underside of the
car.  Tie the rope to the Skoda.  Now go back outside, get in the Skoda and 
drive it any direction you like.  This solves the temporal crisis.  You end up back
on the precarious balcony of the apartment, and a time window opens.  You 
should have drawn one animal here.

BACK AT THE MONUMENT

Now, what haven't we done?  Fire up the clock and press D2.

SUFFRAGETTES

My, you've landed in London, with women demonstrating for the right to vote.
Go down from here, you'll find Black with a petrol bomb (a "bloody great
petrol bomb": a Molotov cocktail).  EEK!  What to do?  Head SW.  At the
fountain, you see this nightingale, which is being difficult.  Get the
newspaper (you need it) and put the cornbread or the madeleine in the
fountain.  The nightingale will come down to eat it and you can sketch it.

That done, go SW again.  There's a bobby here with some intriguing handcuffs
hanging loosely in his back pocket.  Throw the newspaper at the handcuffs,
and the cuffs will fall and the bobby will run off.  Get the cuffs and head
back NE twice to Black.  Well, you've got to stop Black somehow.  You cuff
Black to the fence.  So much for budding romance?  **SIGH**  Wait around at 
the fountain for the time window or use the clock.

BACK AT THE MONUMENT

Just a couple more pieces left.  But you can't get into the park in D1; the
old man just says, "Not yet, I think."  So you go to D4, the Barges.

EGYPT

What a revolting hotel room.  Still, it could be worse.  The door to the north
doesn't want to open.  You have to break it.  It wasn't locked; it was jammed.
Go N, look around, and go NE to the bathroom.  Take the soap (reluctantly).
Back to the room.  Open the shutters and an annoying mosquito gets in.  If you
let it bite you, you will die.  But you can catch it with the soap, and then
you can draw it.

Wait around a bit, and a hook with attached rope conveniently gets thrown on
the window.  Now you can go down.  Get on the barge.  Ummm, Black hasn't
forgotten about the handcuffs....

Down in the barge, look around.  Examine the cans.  Examine Black.  Wait till
Black offers you the signed paper.  Then examine the deck.  Oh my!  You save
both your lives and destroy the paper, which solves the temporal crisis.  
Black isn't exactly happy about it.  Open that strongbox you found in the
cans with the gadget.  The gadget will mollify Black a bit.  Examine the 
passport and the document in the strongbox for some info.  Black is sitting
there scared and weary, and shivering even though it isn't cold.  Maybe Black
has malaria or something.  The blankets aren't takable.  I like to think you
do this out of concern, but you hug or kiss Black (either works).  Ahem.
Next morning, you get a time window.  You need to use the device on this one,
so Black can leave.  Black doesn't seem so lethargic upon catching sight of 
the black ball.  You wonder just how much of the shivering was a ploy.

Take the time window this time.

BACK AT THE MONUMENT

Just one piece left.  D1.  Fire up the clock and go there.

ENDGAME

You can go north through the gates this time.  On the other side, the man
tells you a few things.  You can ask about Black and about the puzzle.  It  
seems that what you have to do is destroy the Kaldecki Machine (which is the
pyramid).  Ask the gatekeeper about the amulet he's wearing, then ask *for*
the amulet.  He'll give it to you.  Head east from the Hinge.  You'll be back 
in....

THE LIVING LAND

The Land is teeming with life now.  There's a pterodactyl overhead!  Don't
be afraid.  Do draw it, though.  Go E and get the rod.  If you've played
Colossal Cave, you'll have a notion of what to do with it.  Go N and sketch
the apes.  Go W to the Pagoda, enter it and get the cage.  Then go E twice
to the SE corner of the pyramid and wave the rod.  Tada!  North across the
bridge, then east.  Pick up the grenade (do NOT go into the Toll Booth - you
WILL die).  Ah!  A way to destroy the pyramid!  But oh dear!  You noticed 
before that you can't get into the pyramid.  Well, you remember that there's a 
river running *under* the pyramid.  Maybe the river can carry it in?  So you 
head west to try this.

And the pterodactyl swoops down and grabs the grenade from you.  Dratted
creature.  You can solve this, though.  Go north to the scree fall.  Wait 
until a large rock falls down and knocks you over.  Go S immediately, then
N again and get all, and S again before you get killed.  Now you've got this
lovely white rock.  Go W, drop the rock, get it again, and the pterodactyl
will swoop down, deposit the grenade in a woodpecker's nest, and grab the
white rock.  Great.  Now the grenade is WAY UP THERE.  You try climbing the
tree, but that doesn't work.  You can't.  You get mad and shake the tree.  The
woodpecker lets you do this now, because it's too busy pecking at the grenade.
TIMBER!  The tree falls with a crash across the river, and the grenade lands 
on the other side.  Sketch the woodpecker.

One more thing you should do now is go W.  You'll startle a rabbit, which is
particularly afraid of the black rod.  Drop the rod *here* and go E twice.  
The rabbit runs off back W, but doesn't go all the way back because it sees 
the rod. Follow it W, and it will scamper south across the tree.  Go retrieve 
your rod and head south to the apes.

The bunny is content here, and now you can sketch it.  The apes have your
grenade, unfortunately.  Try as you might, you can't get it from them.  But
they like to *ape* you, don't they?  You try throwing the rod.  They throw
the grenade, but snatch it back before you can get it.  So you throw the rod
at the rabbit.  Pay dirt!  The grenade goes bouncing off to the east.  Get the
rod and head east twice after it.  

Hmm.  It's in the web of a two-foot spider, and you can't get it.  Well, you
can draw the spider, so do that.  What to do?  Well, go back and get the
woodpecker.  You need the rod, which attracts the woodpecker to you.  You can
put the woodpecker in the cage.  Head quickly back to the spider's web with
the woodpecker, which is doing a number on the wicker cage.  Open the cage.
The woodpecker flies out, and the spider makes a grab for it.  The spider
fails, but it also shakes the grenade loose from the web.  Wonderful!  You
get it.  

Oh no!  It's stuck to your hand!  Pull the pin and you're history.  So you
try washing the grenade.  Just what it needed - the solvents in the polluted
river take the glue right off.  Pant pant.  

There's one more thing you need to do before you destroy the pyramid.  This is
why you have the amulet.  Visit each corner of the Land (NE, NW, SE, SW) and
rub the amulet.  At one of the corners, the great rock balanced there will
spin and throw out a gem for you.  It's random each game which corner gives
you a gem, and you only get one.  There's no point visiting the remaining
corners once you have the gem.

Various portions of the land have historic connotations.  The Toll Booth is
War.  The Pagoda is Art.  I haven't made an effort to figure out all of them,
but your guess is as good as mine.  If you're really curious, ask on
rec.games.int-fiction.

Now, go back to NW of the pyramid, pull the pin, and throw the grenade into 
the river.  The grenade gets washed under the pyramid and goes off.  
Everything dissolves....

TURN OF THE CENTURY

You're back at Century Park...on New Year's Day, 1900!  Children are gathered
around a table to the NW.  Go there.  There's a drawing competition.  Give
Emily's book to Reverend Toby.  He loves the drawings, but too late to enter 
the competition, so he gives you a consolation prize of a Teddy Bear.  I've  
already commented that you must have 4 or more drawings in the book.  If you
don't, go back to a previous save, and draw as many animals in the Living Land
as you need, because you *must* have the Teddy Bear to win the game.

One more thing to do.  Go SE and E.  It's not a beer tent this time, but an
exhibition of futuristic models.  You see that intriguing figure in black...
Go back W to Century Park, and yes, Black is there.  There's not much you can
do.  You've foiled Black at every turn and destroyed the Kaldecki Machine,
stranding the both of you in the past.  What can you do?  So you give Black 
the Teddy Bear.

And you've won!  Black accepts the Teddy Bear, and the two of you go off to
live the 20th century together.  The gem you collected in the Living Land
ensures that it's a comfortable life, too.

You should have 100 points out of 100, 16/16 on the drawing game, and a nice
gem to make your life together comfortable.

Cheers!
